Coursera - Practical Machine Learning - Project Submission

The RMD, MD, and HTML files are included in this repository. To view the submission, I found it to be the most convenient to 
look at the MD file as it contains the code and figures rendered in a readable format.

If you are really interested in looking at the HTML file, I suggest going to:

https://htmlpreview.github.io/

And entering the link for the file. The completed link is here:

Thank you for reviewing my project. I welcome your feedback!
